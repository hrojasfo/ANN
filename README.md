This is an Artificial Neural Network with these features:

- Variable neural layers and number of neurons per level.
- Retropropagation usign error descent.
- Activation function is fixed to sigmoid.
- Interface to access the MNIST digits training data.
- Can be trained with data defined in a text file.
- Variable number of epochs and number of training samples used.
